# **StellarEdu: Blockchain Certificate Validator**

### **Project Description (Prompt 1)**

**StellarEdu: Blockchain Certificate Validator** is an innovative educational platform implemented on the **Stellar Blockchain** to validate high school academic achievements through NFT certificates stored permanently on-chain. The project utilizes the Unity engine to integrate a **Secure Login feature via xBull Wallet and XLM**, adhering to the **SEP-0007** protocol standard.

**This system adopts the successful mechanism from my previous prototype built with Thirdweb SDK and EVM (Ethereum)**, where quiz certificates were pre-stored on the blockchain, allowing students to access them instantly after validation. By migrating to Stellar, the system now offers significantly lower transaction fees (**XLM**) and an instantaneous certificate distribution process for the educational ecosystem.

### **Vision Statement (Prompt 2)**

The vision of this project is to create a future where every educational certificate holds high digital credibility and is transparently accessible to all high school students. By leveraging the speed and cost-efficiency of the Stellar network, we aim to eliminate the risk of certificate forgery through secure on-chain validation. The ultimate goal is to build permanent digital academic portfolios, simplifying the verification process for institutions and industries globally using inclusive Web3 technology.

### **Software Development Plan (Prompt 3)**

1. **Environment Setup**: Integrating the Stellar SDK into Unity and configuring the Horizon API to monitor Testnet activity.
2. **Secure Auth System**: Implementing a SEP-0007 based QR Code login for xBull Wallet connection without compromising private data.
3. **Smart Contract Logic**: Developing smart contract logic (Soroban) with `studentAddress` and `certID` variables for NFT validation and claiming functions.
4. **UI & Quiz Development**: Building an interactive chemistry quiz interface (e.g., Balancing Reactions 2Fe + 3CO_2 \rightarrow \dots) and an automatic **XLM** balance synchronization system.
5. **NFT Inventory System**: Developing an in-game feature that allows students to view and download their on-chain NFT certificates.
6. **Deployment**: Launching the system to the Stellar Testnet for end-to-end testing of the verification and claiming process.

### **About Me (Prompt 4)**

* **Name:** Muhammad Guntur Sa’dillah
* **Location:** Mantuil, Banjarmasin Selatan
* **Education:** High School Graduate

I am an IT enthusiast aspiring to become an educational game developer for students. My journey began with significant challenges; coming from a humble background and fighting since birth as a premature twin weighing only 1.7 kg. Despite following a high school education path, my curiosity for Unity and Web3 technology drove me to master programming **self-taught**. This certificate validator project is my commitment to proving that with strong determination, anyone can innovate with the Stellar blockchain to create a real impact on educational transparency.

### **Installation Guide (Prompt 5)**

1. **Unity Setup**: Ensure you are using Unity 6 (6000.0.61f1).
2. **Configuration**: Open the `XBullLogin` object in the Hierarchy and enter your Stellar Testnet address in the **Public Address** field.
3. **Run Project**: Press **Play** and click **LogginButton** to generate the login QR code.
4. **Login Process**: Open the **xBull Wallet** app on your phone, scan the QR code, and confirm the connection.
5. **Validation**: Once connected, your **XLM** balance will appear, indicating the system is ready for certificate validation.

### **Proof of Concept: Existing EVM Implementation**

As a technical reference, I successfully built a functional prototype on the **EVM (Ethereum Sepolia)** network using the **Thirdweb SDK**.

* **Pre-Stored Certificates**: Quiz certificates were minted and stored on the **Thirdweb** platform beforehand, allowing players to simply verify their win to download them.
* **Strategic Migration**: This project is currently migrating to Stellar to achieve a much more economical transaction cost (**XLM**) for both schools and students.

> Project Idea: XML-Based Authentication System in Unity

This project focuses on designing and implementing a secure login and authentication system within the Unity engine using XML for data structuring. The system handles user credentials, data parsing, and local/remote validation to manage player sessions effectively.
